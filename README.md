# Military project
## About functional:
This project aims to digitise military personnel files, making it easier to work with personal data and thus faster. The project includes sections for searching for a case, filtering by a certain category, adding new cases (data is downloaded from excel sheets, you just need to select a file and the data is loaded into the database), and viewing additional information (the functionality is available when searching for a case). 

The project contains authorisation, where only the administrator has the right to add new users (in the test mode, there is only 1 administrator and it is impossible to create a new one).
